In the Black Ball line I served my time

*To me way-aye-aye, hurray-ah*

And that\'s the line where you can shine

*Hurrah for the Black Ball Line*

The Black Ball Ships are good and true

They are the ships for me and you

For once there was a Black Ball Ship

That fourteen knots an hour could clip

They\'ll carry you along through frost and snow

And take you where the wind don\'t blow

You will surely find a rich gold mine

Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line

Just take a trip to Liverpool

To Liverpool, that Yankee school

The Yankee sailors you\'ll see there

With red-top boots and short-cut hair

At Liverpool docks we bid adieu

To friends and loves, but still sing true
