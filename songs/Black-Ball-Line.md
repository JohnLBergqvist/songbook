In the Black Ball line I served my time\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurray-ah_\
And that's the line where you can shine\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

The Black Ball Ships are good and true\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurray-ah_\
They are the ships for me and you\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_\
\
For once there was a Black Ball Ship\
That fourteen knots an hour could clip

They'll carry you along through frost and snow\
And take you where the wind don't blow

You will surely find a rich gold mine\
Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line

Just take a trip to Liverpool\
To Liverpool, that Yankee school

The Yankee sailors you'll see there\
With red-top boots and short-cut hair

At Liverpool docks we bid adieu\
To friends and loves, but still sing true
