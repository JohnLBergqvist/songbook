Sweet ladies of Plymouth, we're saying goodbye\
_Ro-o-o-oll down!_\
But we'll rock you and roll you again bye and bye\
_Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!_\
_And we will ro-o-o-oll down!_\
_Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!_

Now the anchor's aweigh and the sails are unfurled\
_Ro-o-o-oll down!_\
And we're bound for to take her half-way round the world\
_Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!_\
_And we will ro-o-o-oll down!_\
_Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!_

In the wide Bay of Biscay the seas will run high\
And the poor sickly transports they'll wish they could die

When the wild coast of Africa it do appear\
The poor nervous transports they'll tremble with fear

When the Cape of Good Hope it is rounded at last\
The poor lonesome transports they'll long for the past

When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout\
The poor simple transports they'll goggle and shout

And when we arrive off Australia's strand\
The poor weary transports they'll long for the land

And when we set sail for old England's shore\
The poor stranded transports we'll see them no more

Then sweet ladies of Plymouth we'll pay all your rent\
And go roving no more till our money's all spent
