Roseanne, sweet Roseanne

*Bye-bye, my Roseanna*

Roseanne, my Roseanne

*I won\'t be home tomorrow*

A dollar a day is a fisherman's pay

It's easy come, easy go away

We're leaving port at break of day

We're sailing out across the bay

Our ship is a sailing around the bend

It's loaded down with fishermen

Roseanne, my Roseanne

I'm going away but not to stay
