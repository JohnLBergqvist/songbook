There was a fair maid and she lived all alone\
She lived all alone on the shore\
No one could she find for to comfort her mind\
But to wander alone on the shore, shore, shore\
_To wander alone on the shore_

There was a brave captain who sailed a fine ship\
Let the wind blow high blow low\
I shall die, I shall die, this young captain did cry\
If I can't have that maid on the shore, shore, shore\
_If I can't have that maid on the shore_

After many persuasions they brought her on board\
Let the wind blow high blow low\
He invited her down to his cabin below\
Farewell to all sorrow and care\
_Farewell to all sorrow and care_

I'll sing you a song, this fair maid did cry\
This captain was weeping for joy\
She sang it so sweetly, so soft and completely\
She sang captain and sailors to sleep\
_Captain and sailors to sleep_

She robbed them of silver, she robbed them of gold\
She robbed them of costly fine fare\
The captain's broadsword she used as an oar\
She rowed her way back to the shore, shore, shore\
_She rowed her way back to the shore_

Oh the men, they were mad and the men, they were sad\
They were deeply sunk down in despair\
To see her go away with her booty so gay\
The rings and her things and her fine fare\
_The rings and her things and her fine fare_

Well, don't be so sad and sunk down in despair\
And you should have known me before\
I sang you to sleep and I robbed you of wealth\
I'm a maiden again on the shore, shore, shore\
I'm a maiden again on the shore

There is a fair maid and she lives all alone\
She lives all alone on the shore\
No one can she find for to comfort her mind\
But to wander alone on the shore, shore, shore\
_To wander alone on the shore_
