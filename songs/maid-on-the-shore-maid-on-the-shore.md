  Also known as _The Mermaid_, this ballad hints that the cunning maid on the
  shore might be a mermaid or siren, luring men to their doom with her sweet
  voice. We've picked bits and pieces from the many versions of the lyrics.

There was a fair maid and she lived all alone\
She lived all alone on the shore-o\
No one could she find for to calm her sweet mind\
As she walked all alone on the shore, shore, shore\
_As she walked all alone on the shore_

There was a brave captain who sailed a fine ship\
Let the wind blow high blow low-o\
"I shall die, I shall die", this young captain did cry\
"If I can't have that maid on the shore, shore, shore\
_If I can't have that maid on the shore"_

After many persuasions they brought her on board\
Let the wind blow high blow low-o\
He invited her down to his cabin below\
Farewell to all sorrow and care-o\
_Farewell to all sorrow and care_\
\
"Oh thank you, oh thank you," this young girl she cried,\
“It's just what I've been waiting for-o\
For I've grown so weary of my maidenhead\
As I walked all alone on the shore, shore, shore\
As I walked all alone on the shore.”

"I'll sing you a song", this fair maid did cry\
This captain was weeping for joy-o\
She sang it so sweetly, so soft and completely\
She sang captain and sailors to sleep-o\
_She sang_ _captain and sailors to sleep_

She robbed them of silver, she robbed them of gold\
She robbed them of costly fine fare-o\
The captain's own sword she used as an oar\
She rowed her way back to the shore, shore, shore\
_She rowed her way back to the shore_

Oh the captain was mad and the men, they were sad\
They were deeply sunk down in despair-o\
To see her away with her booty so gay\
For to roam once again on the shore, shore, shore\
_For to roam once again on the shore_

"Now you must be mad and your men must be sad,\
Oh your men must be deep in despair-o\
I sang you to sleep and I robbed you of wealth\
Once again I'm a maid on the shore, shore, shore\
_Once_ _again I'm a maid on the shore."_
