Don\'t mind the rain or the rolling sea

The weary night never worries me

But the hardest time in a sailor\'s day

Is to watch the sun as it dies away

And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

The finest ship that sails the sea

Is still a prison for the likes of me

But give me wings like Noah\'s dove

I\'ll fly up harbour to the girl I love

And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

There was a time my heart was free

Like a floating spar on the open sea.

But now the spar is washed ashore,

It comes to rest at my real love\'s door.

It\'s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.

Every time I gaze behind the screws

Makes me long for old Peter\'s shoes.

I\'d walk right down that silver lane

And take my love in my arms again.

It\'s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.

Oh Lord if dreams were only real

I\'d feel my hands on that wooden wheel

And with all my heart I\'d turn her round

And tell the boys that we\'re homeward bound

And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

I\'ll pass the time like some machine

Until the waters turn to green

Then I\'ll dance on down that walk ashore

And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more

And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more

*Written by Cyril Tawney, this melancholy shanty reflects on his time in
the Navy and was written shortly before he left in 1959*: *'This was the
last song I wrote before I left the Royal Navy in 1959. 'The Grey Funnel
Line' is the sailors\' nickname for the Royal Navy---just as if it were
another mercantile line. It\'s a straightforward song about a sailor
leaving home and the loved one. He\'s extremely fed up with the Senior
Service and he\'d rather be outside, but he has to go away yet again. On
occasions like this I think the close of the first day out, as the sun
is setting, is the time when we\'re most vulnerable to nostalgia.
There\'s a shanty with the refrain 'Rock and roll me over for one more
day', and this gave me the idea for my own refrain 'It\'s one more day
on The Grey Funnel Line'.'*
