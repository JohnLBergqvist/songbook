When the Alabama's keel was laid

> Roll, Alabama, roll

It was laid in the yards of Jonathan Laird

> Oh roll, Alabama, roll

It was laid in the yards of Jonathan Laird\
It was laid in the town of Birkenhead

Down the Mersey way she sailed then\
Liverpool fitted her with guns and men

Down Mersey way she sailed forth\
To destroy the commerce of the North

To Cherbourg harbour she sailed one day\
To collect her share of the prize money

And many a sailor saw his doom\
When the Yankee Kearsage hove into view

A shot from the forward pivot that day\
Took the Alabama's gear away

Off the three mile limit in sixty-four\
The Alabama sank to the ocean floor
