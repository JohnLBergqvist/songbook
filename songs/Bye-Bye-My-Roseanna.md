The boats are sailing round the bay,\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
All loaded down with fishermen,\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_\
> _Bye-bye, my Roseanna_\
> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_\
> _I won't be home tomorrow_

A dollar a day is a fisherman's pay\
It's easy come, easy go away

We're leaving port at break of day\
We're sailing out across the bay

Around the horn we must go,\
The gales are strong and the winds do blow,

Roseanne, my Roseanne\
I'm going away but not to stay
