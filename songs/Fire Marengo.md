Lift him up and carry him along

> *Fire Marengo, fire away!*

Stow him down where he belongs

> *Fire Marengo, fire away!*

Ease him in and let him lay

We'll screw him down and there he'll stay

Stow him down in the hold below

Screw him down and then we\'ll go

When I get back to London town

I\'ll pass my line to little Sally Brown

Sally she\'s a pretty little craft

She's sharp to the fore with a rounded aft

I\'ll haul her high I\'ll haul her low

I\'ll bust her blocks and make her go

Screw the cotton, screw him down

Bound away from Hilo Town

Thought I heard the old man say

That's one last turn and then belay

Lift him up and carry him along

Stow him down where he belongs
