Willie Taylor, youthful lover,\
Full of love and loyalty,\
Just as he was about to get married\
Pressed he was and sent to sea.



But the bride soon followed after

Under the name o' Richard Carr:

Snow-white fingers long and slender,

A' covered over wi' pitch and tar.



She's buttoned on the sailor's clothing,

Dressed herself up like a man;

Away she sailed like a tarry sailor

All aboard the Mary Anne.



A storm arose upon the ocean,

She being there among the rest.

The wind blew off her silver buttons;

Then appeared her snow-white breast.



One day in the heat of battle,

Shot and shell were flying there.

Silver button flew off her waistcoat,

Left her lily-white breast quite bare.



“Now,” says the captain, “My fair lady,

Come pray tell me what's his name?”

“Some folk ca' him Billy Tailor,

But Willie Taylor is his name.”



“If Billy Taylor's your true lover,

He has proved to you untrue;

He's got married tae another,

Left ye here alone to rue.



“Rise ye early in the mornin',

Early by the break o' day,

There you'll see young Billy Taylor

Walking out with his lady gay.”



She rose early the next mornin',

Early by the break o' day,

There she saw young Billy Taylor

Walking out with his lady gay.



Gun and pistol she's commanded,

Gun and pistol by her side;

She has shot young Billy Taylor

Walkin' oot wi' his new-made bride.



“Now,” says the captain, “My fair lady,

Come tell me what you've done.”

“I have shot young Billy Taylor

Wi' a double-barred gun.”



When the captain did behold her

And the deed that she has done,

He has made her chief commander

Over a ship and a hundred men.
