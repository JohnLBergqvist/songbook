Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you,

Away you rolling river.

Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you

Away, I\'m bound away

Across The wide Missouri.

Oh Shenandoah, I love your Daughter,

For her I\'d cross your roaming waters,

\'Tis seven years since last I\'ve seen you,

\'Tis seven years since last I\'ve seen you,

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,

Oh Shenandoah, just to be near you,
