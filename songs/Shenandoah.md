Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you,\
_Away you rolling river._\
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you\
_Away, I'm bound away_\
_Across The wide Missouri._

Oh Shenandoah, I love your Daughter,\
_Away you rolling river._\
For her I'd cross your roaming waters,\
_Away, I'm bound away_\
_Across The wide Missouri._\
__\
'Tis seven years since last I've seen you,\
_Away you rolling river._\
'Tis seven years since last I've seen you,\
_Away, I'm bound away_\
_Across The wide Missouri._

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,\
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,\
Oh Shenandoah, just to be near you,
