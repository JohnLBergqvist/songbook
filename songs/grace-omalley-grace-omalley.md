Now in sailor's clothes Grannuaile did go

A bold sea captain from top to toe

Her clans and children were the greatest care of

Grace O'Malley

Grace O'Malley whom never did despair



Her trade was maintenanced by land and sea

200 loyal men were her army

No other captain was so skilled or brave as 

Grace O'Malley

Grace O'Malley who ruled the stormy waves



\[melody instrumental]



They had not saileth far from Clew Bay

When she spied a vessel bound for Galway

"Those are sea merchants!" Granua duid cry and

Granuaile 

Granuaile will stop that ship or die



They stopped that ship and took it's store

She returned to old Erin's shore

With Spanish brandy she walked along with

Did Granuaile, who sweetly sang a song (not totally sure about these two lines)



\[Spanish flamenco instrumental]



Queen Elizabeth did once suggest

That she would make Grace a countess

"Oh no" said Grace, "That would never do for

Grace O'Malley

For Grace O'Malley is as great a queen as you."



A queen uncommon by land and sea

Her strength commandeth fierce loyalty

Her wealth provideth for many's the clans of

Grace O'Malley

Grace O'Malley, sea woman of Ireland
