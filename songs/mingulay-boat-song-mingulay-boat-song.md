_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys!_\
_Bring her head round, and all together._\
_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys,_\
_Sailing homeward to Mingulay._

What care we though, white the Minch is?\
What care we for wind or weather?\
Pull her round, boys, every inch is\
Heading homeward to Mingulay.

_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys!_\
_Bring her head round, and all together._\
_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys,_\
_Sailing homeward to Mingulay._

Wives are waiting at the pier head,\
looking seaward from the heather;\
They'll return though, when the sun sets\
They'll return to Mingulay.

_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys!_\
_Bring her head round, and all together._\
_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys,_\
_Sailing homeward to Mingulay._\
__\
Ships return now, heavy laden,\
Mothers holding bairns a-crying.\
Let her go boys, and we'll anchor\
'Ere the sun sets on Mingulay.

_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys!_\
_Bring her head round, and all together._\
_Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys,_\
_Sailing homeward to Mingulay._
