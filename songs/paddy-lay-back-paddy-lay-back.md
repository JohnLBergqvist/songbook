_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack_\
_Take a turn around the capstan, heave a-pawl_\
_About ship's station boys be handy_\
_For we're off to Valparaiso in the morn_

That day there was a great demand for sailors\
For the colonies, for Frisco, and for France\
So I shipped aboard a Limey bark, 'The Hotspur'\
And I got paralytic drunk on my advance

_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack_\
_Take a turn around the capstan, heave a-pawl_\
_About ship's station boys be handy_\
_For we're off to Valparaiso in the morn_

There were Dutchmen, Spaniards, and Russians\
And jolly boys just across from France\
Not a one of them could speak a word of English\
But the answered to the name of 'Month's Advance'

_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack..._

Now some of the lads they had been drinkin'\
And meself was heavy on the booze\
So I sat upon my old sea-chest a -thinkin'\
That I'd crawl into me bunk and have a snooze

_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack..._

I woke up in the morning sick and sore\
For I knew I was outward bound again\
When I heard a voice bawling at the door\
Get up ye bastard and listen to your name

_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack..._

Well I wish I was in the Jolly Sailor\
Along with Irish navvies drinkin' beer\
When I thought what jolly lads were sailors\
And with me flipper I wiped away a tear

_Paddy lay back, Take in your slack..._
