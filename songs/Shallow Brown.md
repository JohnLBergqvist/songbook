Oh I'm going to leave her

Shallow, oh Shallow Brown

Oh I'm going to leave her

Shallow, oh Shallow Brown

Ship on board a Whaler

I'm gonna ship on board a Whaler

Bound away to St. George's

Bound away to St. George's

Love you well Julianna

I love you well Julianna

Master's going to sell me

Master's going to sell me

Sell me to a Yankee

He's gonna sell me to a Yankee

Sell me for a dollar

A great big Spanish dollar

Gonna cross them distant mountains

I'm gonna find them crystal fountains
