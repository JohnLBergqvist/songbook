When I was a youngster I sailed with the rest

On a Liverpool packet bound out for the West.

We anchored one day in the harbor of Cork,

Then we put out for the port of New York.

*And it\'s row, row bullies, row,*

*Them Liverpool judies have got us in tow.*

For forty two days we was hungry and sore.

Oh, the winds was again\'us, the gales, they did roar.

But off Battery Point we did anchor at last

With our jib\'boom hove to and the canvas all fast.

The boarding house masters was off in a trice

A\'shouting and promising all that was nice,

And one fat old crimp took a fancy to me.

Says he, "You\'re a fool, lad, to follow the sea.\'\'

Says he, "There\'s a job as is waiting for you,

With lashings o\'liquor and bugger\'all to do.\'\'

Says he, "Wha\'d\'yer say, lad, will you jump her too?\'\'

Says I, "You old bastard, I\'m damned if I do.\'\'

But the best of intentions, they never goes far.

After thirty two days at the door of a bar

I tossed off me liquor and what do you think?

That rotten old bastard had drugs in me drink.

The next I remember, I woke in the morn

On a three skys\'l yarder bound south round Cape Horn.

With an old suit of oilskins and two pairs of socks

And a bloomin\' great head and a dose of the pox.

Now all you young sailors take a warnin\' by me.

Keep an eye on yer drinks when the liquor is free.

And pay no attention to runner or whore

When your hat\'s on your head and your feet\'s on the shore.
