Oh! I once was a rigger and I worked like hell.

Rolling up, rolling down,

But now I\'m sailing with the OCL

And go rolling down the river.

Rolling up, rolling down.

We\'ll all get drunk in Tilbury town

Twenty four hours to turn around.

And go rolling down the river.

When first I saw a TEU.

I wondered where they stowed the crew

To go rolling down the river.

Well cargo comes in TEU\'s.

A 20 foot box, boys, filled with booze.

There\'s a Tilbury girl called kettle Jane.

First on the boil then off again.

She\'s got a mate called teapot Anne.

She gets well brewed, she likes a man.

Tilbury girls go round in pairs,

You won\'t catch them unawares.

Well, we\'re the boys to see her through.

So to hell the channel and the TEU.

Let\'s roll down the river.
