When first I landed in Liverpool, I went upon a spree

Me money alas I spent it fast, got drunk as drunk could be

And when me money was all gone, \'twas then I wanted more

But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more

*Once more, once more, I'll go to sea once more*

*A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more*

I spent the night with Angeline too drunk to roll in bed

Me watch was new and me money too, in the morning with them she fled

And as I walked the streets about, the whores they all did roar

There goes Jack Spratt, the poor sailorlad, he must go to sea once more

*Once more, once more, I'll go to sea once more*

*There goes Jack Spratt, the poor sailorlad, he must go to sea once
more*

And as I walked the streets about, I met with the Rapper Brown

I asked him for to take me on and he looked at me with a frown

He said last time you was paid off with me you could no score

But I\'ll give you a chance and I\'ll take your advance and I\'ll send
you to sea once more

*Once more, once more, I'll send you to sea once more*

*I\'ll give you a chance and I\'ll take your advance and I\'ll send you
to see once more*

He shipped me on board a whaling ship bound for the arctic seas

Where the cold winds blow through the frost and snow and Jamaica rum
would freeze

But worse to bear, I\'d no hard weather gear for I\'d spent all money on
shore

\'twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more

*No more, no more, I'll go to sea no more*

*\'twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more*

So come all you bold seafaring men, who listen to me song

When you come off them long trips, I\'ll have you not go wrong

Take my advice, drink no strong drink, don\'t go sleeping with them
whores

Get married instead and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more

*No more, no more, I'll go to sea no more*

> *Get married instead and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more*
