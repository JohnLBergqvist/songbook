description: >-
  Screwing cotton was one of the hardest tasks aboard ship: using jackscrews to
  compress and force bales of cotton into the hold until they were packed solid.
  There's no consensus on what 'Marengo' means.

Lift him up and carry him along

> _Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Stow him down where he belongs

> _Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Ease him in and let him lay\
We'll screw him down and there he'll stay

Stow him down in the hold below\
Screw him down and then we'll go

When I get back to London town\
I'll pass my line to little Sally Brown

Sally she's a pretty little craft\
She's sharp to the fore with a rounded aft

I'll haul her high I'll haul her low\
I'll bust her blocks and make her go

Screw the cotton, screw him down\
Bound away from Hilo Town

Thought I heard the old man say\
That's one last turn and then belay
