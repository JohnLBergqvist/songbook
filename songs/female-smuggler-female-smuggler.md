Come listen awhile and you soon shall hear

By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair

Her father was of the smuggling trade

Like a war-like hero, like a war-like hero, she never was afraid



Now, in sailor's clothing swell Jane did go,

Dressed like a sailor from top to toe;

Her aged father was the only care

Of this female smuggler,

\    Of this female smuggler

\    Who never did despair.



With her pistols loaded she went aboard.

And by her side hung a glittering sword,

In her belt two daggers; well armed for war

Was this female smuggler,

\    Was this female smuggler,

\    Who never feared a scar.



Now they had not sail-ed far from the land,

When a strange sail brought them to a stand.

"These are sea robbers," this maid did cry,

"But the female smuggler,

\    But the female smuggler,

\    Will conquer or will die."



Alongside, then, this strange vessel came.

"Cheer up " cried Jane," we will board the same;

We'll run all chances to rise or fall,"

Cried this female smuggler,

\    Cried this female smuggler,

\    Who never feared a ball.



Now they killed those pirates and took their store,

And soon returned to Old England's shore.

With a keg of brandy she walked along,

Did this female smuggler,

\    Did this female smuggler,

\    Who sweetly sang a song.



Now Ihey wwe followed by Ihe blockade,

Who in irons strong did put this young maid.

But when they brought her to be tried,

This young female smuggler,

\    This young female smuggler

\    Stood dressed like a bride.



Their commodore against her appeared,

And for her life she greatly feared.

When he did find to his great surprise

'Twas a female smuggler,

\    'Twas a female smuggler

\    Had fought him in disguise.



He to the judge and jury said,

"l cannot prosecute this maid,

Pardon for her on my knees I crave,

For this female smuggler,

\    For this female smuggler

\    So valiant and so brave."



Then this commodore to his father went,

To gain her hand he asked his consent.

His consent he gained, so the commodore

And the female smuggler,

\    And the female smuggler

\    Are one for evermore.
