  _Written by Cyril Tawney, this melancholy shanty reflects on his time in the Navy_:
  _'This was the last song I wrote before I left the Royal Navy in
  1959. 'The Grey Funnel Line' is the sailors' nickname for the Royal Navy-just
  as if it were another mercantile line. It's a straightforward song about a
  sailor leaving home and the loved one. He's extremely fed up with the Senior
  Service and he'd rather be outside, but he has to go away yet again. On
  occasions like this I think the close of the first day out, as the sun is
  setting, is the time when we're most vulnerable to nostalgia.'_

Don't mind the rain or the rolling sea\
The weary night never worries me\
But the hardest time in a sailor's day\
Is to watch the sun as it dies away\
_And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line_

The finest ship that sails the sea\
Is still a prison for the likes of me\
But give me wings like Noah's dove\
I'll fly up harbour to the girl I love\
_And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line_

There was a time my heart was free\
Like a floating spar on the open sea\
But now the spar is washed ashore\
It comes to rest at my real love's door\
_It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line_

Every time I gaze behind the screws\
Makes me long for old Peter's shoes\
I'd walk right down that silver lane\
And take my love in my arms again\
_It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line_

Oh Lord if dreams were only real\
I'd feel my hands on that wooden wheel\
And with all my heart I'd turn her round\
And tell the boys that we're homeward bound\
_And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line_

I'll pass the time like some machine\
Until the waters turn to green\
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore\
_And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more_\
_And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more_
