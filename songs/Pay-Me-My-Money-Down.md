I thought I heard our captain say\
_Pay me my money down_\
Tomorrow is our sailing day\
_Pay me my money down_

_Pay me, Oh pay me_\
_Pay me my money down_\
_Pay me or go to jail_\
_Pay me my money down_

Soon as the boat was clear of the bar\
He knocked me down with the end of a spar

I wish I was Mr Howard's son\
Sit in the house and drink good rum

I wish I was Mr Steven's son\
Sit on the bank and watch the work done
