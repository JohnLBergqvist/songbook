Sunset and evening star,\
And one clear call for me!\
And may there be no moaning of the bar\
When I put out to sea.

_When I put out to sea, when I put out to sea._\
_And may there be no moaning of the bar_\
_When I put out to sea._

Twilight and evening bell,\
And after that the dark!\
And may there be no sadness or farewell\
When I embark.

_When I embark, when I embark,_\
_And may there be no sadness or farewell_\
_When I embark._

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\
Too full for sound and foam,\
When that which drew from out the boundless deep\
Turns again home.

_Turns again home, turns again home,_\
_When that which drew from out the boundless deep_\
_Turns again home._

For though from out our bourne of time and place\
The flood may bear me far,\
I hope to see my Pilot face to face\
When I have crossed the bar.

_When I have crossed the bar, when I have crossed the bar._\
_I hope to see my Pilot face to face_\
_When I have crossed the bar._
