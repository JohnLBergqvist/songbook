description: >-
  An ironic singing of verse 3 can be enhanced with another verse in dialogue.
  I've had a stab here where our sailor discovers that maybe he doesn't want to
  kiss the girls after all...

Louis was the king of France\
Before the revolut-i-on

_Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe_

But then he got his head chopped off

Which spoiled his constitut-i-on

_Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe_

> _(To me) way, haul away_
>
> _We'll heave and hang together_
>
> _Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe_

Once I was in Ireland\
Digging turf and pratties\
And now I'm on a Yankee ship\
Hauling on sheets and braces

Now when I was a little boy\
And so me mother told me\
That if I didn't kiss the girls\
Me lips would all grow mouldy

\*\*\*\*Well now I only kiss the boys\
It's them I like to hold me\
I can't say I miss the girls\
And me lips did not go mouldy\*\**

Way haul away\
We'll haul away the bowline\
Way, haul away\
The packet is a-rollin'
