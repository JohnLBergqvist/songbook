To Cuba's coast we're bound me boys\
_Way, me boys, for Cuba_\
To Cuba's coast boys, don't you make a noise\
_Running down to Cuba._

> _Way, me boys, for Cuba_
> _Running down to Cuba_

The Captain he will trim the sails\
_Way, me boys, for Cuba_\
Flinging the water out over the rails\
_Running down to Cuba._

_Way, me boys, for Cuba_\
_Running down to Cuba_

Oh my lord! how the wind do blow
Running South from the ice and snow

Oh, I've got a gal who's nine feet tall
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall

Give me a gal who can dance Fandango
I'll woo her with melon, papaya and mango

To Cuba's coast we are bound, away
To Cuba's coast at the breaking of the day
