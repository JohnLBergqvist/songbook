I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War

Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War

Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

Pretty work, brave boys

Pretty work, I say

Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

Pretty work, brave boys

Pretty work, I say

Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Bosun aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the saw bones aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Captain, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the shanty man aboard a Man O\'War
