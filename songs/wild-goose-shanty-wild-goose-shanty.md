Did you ever see the wild goose sailing on the ocean\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_\
They're just like them pretty girls when they get the notion\
Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray

Chorus:

_Ranzo you'll rue the day_\
_As the wild goose sails away_

As I was walking one evening by the river\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_\
I met with a pretty girl my heart it was a quiver\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_

_(Chorus x 2)_

I said how are you doing this morning\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_\
She said none the better for the seeing of you\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_

_(Chorus x 2)_

You broke my heart oh you broke it full sore o'\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_\
If I sail like the wild goose\
You'll break it no more\
_Ranzo my boys oh Ranzo Ray_
