Now we are ready to head for the horn,\
_Weigh, hey, roll an' go!_\
Our boots an' our clothes boys are all in the pawn,\
_To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!_

Heave a pawl, oh, heave away,\
_Weigh, hey, roll and go!_\
The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored,\
_To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!_

Man the stout caps'n and heave with a will,\
For soon we'll be drivin' her 'way up the hill.

Heave away, bullies, ye parish-rigged bums,\
Take yer hands from yer pockets and don't suck yer thumbs.

We're outward bound for Vallipo bay,\
Get crackin', me lads, it's a hell of a way!
