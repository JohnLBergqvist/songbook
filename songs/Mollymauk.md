Oh the southern ocean is a lonely place

Where the storms are many and the shelter's scarce

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

On the restless water and the troublin' skies

You can see that mollymauk wheel and fly

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird

Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

See the Mollymauk floatin' on his wide white wings

And lord, what a lonely song he sings

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

And he's got no compass and he's got no gear

And there's none can tell you how the Mollymauks steer

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

He's the ghost of a sailor-man as i've heard say

Who's body sank, and his soul flew away

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

And he's got no haven and he's got no home

He's bound evermore for to wheel and roam

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

When I gets too weary for to sail no more

Let my bones sink better far away from shore

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn

You can cast me loose and leave me driftin' free

And I'll keep that big bird company

Down upon the southern ocean sailing

Down below cape horn
