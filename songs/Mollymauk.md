  Mollymauk is another name for the albatross and one superstition was that the

Oh the southern ocean is a lonely place\
Where the storms are many and the shelter's scarce\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_\
On the restless water and the troublin' skies\
You can see that mollymauk wheel and fly\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

_Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird_\
_Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk_\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

See the Mollymauk floatin' on his wide white wings\
And Lord, what a lonely song he sings\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_\
And he's got no compass and he's got no gear\
And there's none can tell you how the Mollymauks steer\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

_Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird_\
_Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk_\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_\
\
He's the ghost of a sailor-man as I've heard say\
Whose body sank, and his soul flew away\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_\
And he's got no haven and he's got no home\
He's bound evermore for to wheel and roam\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

_Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird_\
_Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk_\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_\
__\
When I gets too weary for to sail no more\
Let my bones sink better far away from shore\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

You can cast me loose and leave me driftin' free\
And I'll keep that big bird company\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_

_Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird_\
_Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk_\
_Down upon the southern ocean sailing_\
_Down below Cape Horn_
