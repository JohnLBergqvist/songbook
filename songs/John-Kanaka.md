I thought I heard the old man say

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

Today, today is a holiday

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

_Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay (hoo)_

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

We'll work tomorrow but no work today\
We'll work tomorrow but no work today

We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay\
We're bound away at the break of day

We're bound away 'round Cape Horn\
We wish to Christ we'd never been born

Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away\
Oh haul away and make your pay

And we are Liverpool born and bred\
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head
