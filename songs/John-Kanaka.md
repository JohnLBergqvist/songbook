  We love this song and it is an absolute favourite on all our nights!


  Kanakas historically refers to workers from the Pacific Islands who were
  employed by their colonisers. Sadly, in Australia it is a charged and hateful
  term, where descendants of Kanakas are recognised to be more disadvantaged
  than indigenous populations. This song then gives some racial identity to
  complaints of mistreatment on the ocean, with a cheery melody.

I thought I heard the old man say

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

Today, today is a holiday

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

_Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay (hoo)_

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

We'll work tomorrow but no work today\
We'll work tomorrow but no work today

We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay\
We're bound away at the break of day

We're bound away 'round Cape Horn\
We wish to Christ we'd never been born

Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away\
Oh haul away and make your pay

And we are Liverpool born and bred\
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head
