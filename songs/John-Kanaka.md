  We love this song and it is an absolute favourite on all our nights!


  But...'kanaka' is a word from the Hawai'ian for man, which came to be used in
  English to describe workers from the Pacific Islands who were employed by
  their colonisers. Sadly, in Australia it is a charged and hateful racist term,
  where descendants of kanakas are recognised to be even more disadvantaged than
  indigenous populations. This song gives some specific racial identity to
  complaints of mistreatment on the ocean, with a cheery melody.


  We're not sure what to do with this one - we could replace 'John Kanaka' with
  'John, here comes the bosun', or 'Auntie Shanty Shanty' or...?

I thought I heard the old man say

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

Today, today is a holiday

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

_Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay (hoo)_

_John, here comes the Bosun, too lie ay_

We'll work tomorrow but no work today\
We'll work tomorrow but no work today

We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay\
We're bound away at the break of day

We're bound away 'round Cape Horn\
We wish to Christ we'd never been born

Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away\
Oh haul away and make your pay

And we are Liverpool born and bred\
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head
