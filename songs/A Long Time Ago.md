In \'Frisco Bay there were three ships,

*To me way, hey, hey, oh.*

In \'Frisco Bay there were three ships,

*A long time ago.*

And one of those ships was Noah\'s old ark,

Covered all over with hickory bark.

They took two animals of every kind,

They took two animals of every kind.

The bull and the cow they started to row,

The bull and the cow they started to row.

Then said old Noah with a flick of his whip,

Come stop this row or I\'ll scuttle the ship.

But the bull stuck his hoof through the side of the ark,

And the little black dog he started to bark.

So Noah took the dog, stuck its nose in the hole,

And ever since then, the dog\'s nose has been cold.

It's a long, long time, and a very long time,

A long, long time, and a very long time.
