When the boats all get to sailing and the men are off and gone\
What about the women who are up and left alone\
Do you think they sit and twiddle thumbs until their men come home\
Ha! There's other things to twiddle when a girl's left on her own.

_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay_\
_Well it's oftentimes a man will leave you broken with dismay_\
_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay_\
_But there's other things to twiddle when your man has sailed away._

Well, I remember Nancy, she was young and she was gay\
She won the heart of Captain Dan until he sailed away\
He left her high and dry with just a kiss upon the chin\
But as his ship went sailing out, another ship sailed in.

_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay..._\
\
And then there was Lucinda Brown, as fair as any maid\
Her true love went a voyaging, a sailorman by trade\
"Oh, keep the fire burning, love," those are the words he spoke\
So she found herself another man to keep that fire stoked.

_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay..._

Lucy Jeffers' man came back and knocked upon the door\
She was as glad to see him as she'd ever been before\
He left her sleeping in the bed, but Lucy didn't care\
Cuz the poor guy in the closet sure could use a little air.\
\
_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay..._

Oh you hear a lot of stories 'bout the sailors and their sport\
About how every sailor has a girl in every port\
But if you added two and two, you'd figure out right quick\
It's just because the girls all have a lad on every ship.

_And it's twiddly-i dee-i dee-i, twiddly-i dee-ay..._
