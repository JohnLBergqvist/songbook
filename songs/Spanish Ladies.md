Farewell and adieu unto you spanish ladies

Farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain

For it\'s we\'ve received orders for to sail for old England

But we hope very soon we shall see you again

We hove our ship to with the wind at Sou\'west, boys

We hove our ship to, our soundings to see

So we rounded and sounded; got forty-five fathoms

We squared our main yard and up channel steered we

We\'ll rant and we\'ll roar like true British sailors

We\'ll rant and we\'ll roar across the salt seas

Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England

From Ushant to Ccilly is thirty-five leagues

Now the first land we made it is called the Deadman

Next ram head off Plymouth, off Portland the Wight

We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlee and Dungeness

Till we came abreast of the South Foreland Light

Then the signal was made for the Grand Fleet to anchor

All in the downs that night for to lie

Then it\'s stand by your Stoppers, see clear your Shank-Painters,

Haul all your Clew Garnets, let Tacks and sheets fly

Now let every man toss off a full bumper

And let every man drink off a full glass

And we\'ll drink and be merry and drown melancholy

Singing, here\'s a good health to each true-hearted lass
