Oh in Eighteen hundred and Forty-one

Me corduroy breeches I put on

Oh me corduroy breeches I put on

To work upon the railway, the railway

I\'m weary of the railway

Poor paddy works on the railway

In Eighteen hundred and Forty-two

From hartlepool I moved to crewe

Found myself a job to do

A working on the railway

Fil-i-me-oo-ree-eye-ri-ay

Fil-i-me-oo-ree-eye-ri-ay

Fil-i-me-oo-ree-eye-ri-ay

Working on the railway

In Eighteen hundred and Forty-three

I broke the shovel across me knee

I went to work for the company

On the leeds to Selby railway

In Eighteen hundred and Forty-four

I landed on the liverpool shore

My belly was empty me hands were raw

With working on the railway, the railway

Oh in Eighteen hundred and Forty-one

Me corduroy breeches I put on

Oh me corduroy breeches I put on

To work upon the railway, the railway

I\'m weary of the railway

Poor paddy works on the railway
