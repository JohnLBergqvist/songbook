description: "With a double pull, this shanty was probably used for the Halyard or a long drag. A classic example of a 'stringing-out' shanty - one where one the shanty singer could make up as many verses as required to get the job done. Sung at a shanty session, it's important that you read the room and think carefully about how many verses to include if there are lots of people who would like a sing - it would be totally historically in keeping to shorten (or even lengthen!) the song to match the occasion."

They call me hanging Johnny,

> *Away, boys, away!*

They say I hang for money!

> *So hang, boys, hang down!*

They say I hanged my mother,

My sisters and my brothers

They say I hanged my granny,

I strung her up so canny

They say I hung a copper,

I gave him the long dropper

I\'d hang the mates and skippers,

I\'d hang \'em by their flippers

A rope, a beam, a ladder,

I\'ll hang ye all together

Hang \`em from the yardarm,

Hang the sea and buy a pigfarm

They say I hang for money,

I hang because it's funny

They call me hanging Johnny,

Ain\'t never hanged nobody
