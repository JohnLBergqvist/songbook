It was a Friday morn when we set sail

And we were not far from the land

When our captain, he spied a fishy mermaid

With a comb and a glass in her hand

> *Oh the ocean waves do roll*
>
> *And the stormy winds do blow*
>
> *And we poor sailors are skipping at the top*
>
> *While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below*
>
> *While the landlubbers lie down below*

Up spoke the captain of our gallant ship

And a brave old skipper was he

\"This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom

We shall sink to the bottom of the sea\"

Up spoke the first mate of our gallant ship

And a well-spoken man was he

\"I have me a wife in Salem by the sea

And tonight she a widow will be\"

Up spoke the bosun of our gallant ship

And a brave young man was he

\"Well I\'ve got a sweetheart at St. John\'s by the sea

And tonight she be weepin\' for me\"

Up spoke the cook of our gallant ship

And a greasy old butcher was he

\"I care much more for my pots and my pans

Than I do for the bottom of the sea\"

Then up spoke the cabinboy, of our gallant ship

And a nasty little lad was he

\"I\'m not quite sure I can spell mermaid

But I\'m going to the bottom of the sea\"

Then three times around spun our gallant ship

And three times around spun she

Three times around spun our gallant ship

And she sank to the bottom of the sea
