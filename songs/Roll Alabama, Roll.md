When the Alabama\'s keel was laid

Roll, Alabama, roll

It was laid in the yards of Jonathan Laird

Oh roll, Alabama, roll

It was laid in the yards of Jonathan Laird

It was laid in the town of Birkenhead

Oh roll, Alabama

Roll, Alabama, roll

Oh roll, Alabama

Roll, Alabama, roll

Down the Mersey way she sailed then

Liverpool fitted her with guns and men

Down mersey way she sailed forth

To destroy the commerce of the North

To Cherbourg harbour she sailed one day

To collect her share of the prize money

And many a sailor saw his doom

When the Yankee kearsage hove into view

A shot from the forward pivot that day

Took the Alabama\'s gear away

Off the three mile limit in sixty-four

The Alabama sank to the ocean floor
