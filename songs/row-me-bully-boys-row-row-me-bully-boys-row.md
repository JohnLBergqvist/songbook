_And it's row me bully boys, we're in a hurry boys, we got a long way to go_
_And we'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France_ 
_And it's row me bully boys row_ 


I'll sing you a song, it's a song of the sea 

_Row me bully boys row_

I'll sing you a song if you'll sing it with me 

_And it's row me bully boys row_


_And it's row me bully boys..._



While the first mate is helping the captain aboard

He looks like a peacock with pistols and sword



_And it's row me bully boys..._



The captain likes whiskey, the mate he likes rum 

We like em both but we can't get us none 



_And it's row me bully boys..._



Well come now me lads it is time for to roam

The old Blue Peter she's calling us home



_And it's row me bully boys..._
