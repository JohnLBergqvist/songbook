Come all you true lovers attend for a while to a tale I am going to unfold! \
Young James was a lad who was virtuous and kind, and Flora a sailor so bold. \
“Adieu! Lovely James!” One morning said she, “We are called, I am forced for to go, \
Far from my native shore, when the loud cannons roar, up aloft when the stormy winds blow.” \
_Up_ a_loft when the stormy winds blow!_ \
_Far from my native shore, when the loud cannons roar, up aloft when the stormy winds blow._ 

Oh James how he wept, sad tears from his blue eyes, when young Flora said she must depart \
She broke her ring in two, said “Here's one half for you” and the other she pressed to her heart. \
James wept in despair, tore at his lovely hair, saying “Flora, with you I must go” \
Crying in accents soft “I shall go up aloft with my love, when the stormy winds blow.” \
_With my love, when the stormy winds blow!_ \
_Crying in accents soft..._ 

Said Flora, “Dear James, you surely can't think for to risk your sweet life on the deep? \
And for to go aloft, when on your pillow soft, contented at home you might sleep!” \
He said “I'm not afraid, and none shall me persuade, as determined I am for to go \
Unto some foreign shore where the loud cannons roar, to be with you when stormy winds blow.” \
_To be with you..._ \
_Unto some foreign shore…_ 

Two sailors they shipped out, these lovers so true (for indeed there's no gender in war), \
And though James was afraid, with his Flora he stayed for true love, for their comrades, and more. \
By day and by night these two lovers did fight, and with grit in to battle did go \
Taking no joy in war, many hardships they bore up aloft when the stormy winds blow. \
_Up aloft..._ \
_Taking no joy..._

Five years on the ocean these two they did sail, respected by all the ship's crew. \
And not one did care how young James wore his hair; they know men can be fine sailors too. \
On the bow they did stand, side by side, hand in hand, before once more aloft they did go, \
With no care for his life, James followed his wife up aloft when the stormy winds blow. \
_Up aloft..._ \
_With no care..._

Just a year more had past when young Flora - at last - had the Captaincy gifted with gold \
At the front of the crowd stood young James, and so proud of his Flora he loved to behold. \
So on went the sailors, the lovers, to sea, for when the fight stops, who can know? \
But until the war's o'er there's a young lovers bower up aloft when the stormy winds blow. \
_Up aloft..._ \
_But until…_
