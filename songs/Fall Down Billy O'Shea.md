description: "This shanty tells the common story of being pressed. Between 1664 and 1814, Impressment was used to fill the crews of British navy ships. Any man between 18 and 55 with sailing ability could be pressed into service by the Navy Impressment Service, known as 'The Press Gang'. The punishment for refusing was hanging. Having attempted to plead that they are non sailors, the captain whips Billy O'Shea up the rigging, where his lack of topsman ability soon leads to his early demise. Sir John Rogerson's Quay is a street and quay in Dublin on the south bank of the River Liffey between City Quay in the west and Britain Quay. Named for politician and property developer Sir John Rogerson (1648--1724), the quay was formerly part of Dublin Port. The cat referred to is, of course, the cat o nine tails."

We all got drunk in Dublin city

*Fall down me Billy*

We all got drunk, sure more\'s the pity

*Fall down Billy O\'Shea*

> *Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy*
>
> *We\'re bound away for Americay*
>
> *Fall down Billy O\'Shea*

We lay ourselves down on Sir Rogerson\'s Quay

And when we woke we were out to sea

We are not sailors captain dear

We come from the land and we won't work here

Says the captain, \"I\'ve a cure for that\"

\"And here for a start is a dose of the cat\"

So we sent him up to the top-mast yard

And when he hit the deck, oh! he took it hard

So we wrapped him in the Captain\'s sail

And lowered him gently o\'er the rail

Over the side and down he goes

Down to Davy Jones with a stich through his nose

Oh and as he went I heard him say

I thought we were bound for Americay

We all got drunk in Dublin city

We all got drunk, sure more\'s the pity
