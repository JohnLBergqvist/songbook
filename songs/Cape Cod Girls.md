description: This was likely used as a long haul or halyard shanty. It's a variant on 'South Australia'. The named town could be substituted for the name of another fishing town, should the sailors wish the song's jokes to be at someone else's expense!

Cape Cod men ain\'t got no ale

> *Haul away, haul away*

They fill their glasses with codfish tails

> *And we\'re bound away for Australia*
>
> *So heave away, my bully, bully boys*
>
> *Haul away, haul away*
>
> *Heave away, why don't you make some noise*
>
> *And we\'re bound away for Australia*

Cape Cod kids ain\'t got no sleds

They slide down the hills on codfish heads

Cape Cod girls ain\'t got no frills

They tie their hair with codfish gills

Cape Cod cats ain\'t got no tails

They lost them all in the northeast gales

Cape Cod folk ain't got no ills

Cape Cod doctors give 'em cod fish pills
