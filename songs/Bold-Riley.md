description: A halyard shanty, likely from the West Indies but not recorded until 1952 when it mysteriously appeared on an AL Lloyd record called 'A Sailor's Garland'. During the 19th Century in Liverpool, it was fashionable for wealthier women to wear white cotton stockings. On White-Stocking Day, women were required to draw their \'allotment\' which was the half pay of their sailing family member away at sea. These wives and mothers wore white stockings on that day, considering themselves members of the middle and upper classes for the day.*

Our anchor's aweigh and our sails are set,

*Bold Riley-oh, bold Riley,*

And the folks we're leaving we'll never forget,

*Bold Riley-oh has gone away!*

*Goodbye my sweethear, goodbye my darling,*

*Bold Riley-oh, bold Riley,*

*Goodbye my sweetheart, goodbye my dear heart,*

*Bold Riley-oh has gone away.*

Wake up Mary Ellen, don't look so glum,

On Whitestocking day, you'll be drinking hot rum

And oh it's raining all day long,

And the Northerly Gale, it blows so strong,

So we're outward bound for the Bengal Bay,

Bend your backs me boys, it's a hell of a way.
