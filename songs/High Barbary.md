There were two lofty ships from old England came

*Blow high, blow low and so sail we*

One was the Prince of Luther, the other Prince of Wales

*All a-cruisin\' down the coast of High Barbary *

Aloft there, aloft there our jolly bosun cried

Look ahead, look astern, look to weather an\' a-lee

There\'s naught upon the stern, sir, there\'s naught upon our lee

But there\'s a lofty ship to wind\'ard, an\' she\'s sailin\' fast and
free\"

Oh hail her, oh hail her, our gallant captain cried

Are you a man-o-war, or a privateer?\" cried he

Oh, I\'m not a man-o-war, nor privateer, said he

But I am salt sea pirate all a-looking for me fee

For Broadside, for broadside a long time we lay

\'Til at last the Prince of Luther shot the pirate\'s mast away

Oh quarter, oh quarter those pirates they did cry

But the quarter that we gave them was we sank \'em in the sea
