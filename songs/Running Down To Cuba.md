To Cuba\'s coast we're bound me boys

Way, me boys, for Cuba

To Cuba\'s coast boys, don't you make a noise

Running down to Cuba.

The Captain he will trim the sails

Flinging the water out over the rails

Oh my lord! how the wind do blow

Running South from the ice and snow

Oh, I\'ve got a gal who's nine feet tall

She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall

Give me a gal who can dance Fandango

Round like a melon but sweet as a mango

To Cuba\'s coast we are bound, away

To Cuba\'s coast at the breaking of the day
