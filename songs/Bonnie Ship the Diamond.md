The Diamond is a ship, my lads

For the Davis Strait we\'re bound

The quay it is all garnished

With bonnie friends all round

Captain Thompson gives the order

To sail the ocean wide

Where the sun it never sets, my lads

Nor darkness dims the sky

> *For it\'s cheer up my lads*
>
> *Let your hearts never fail*
>
> *For the bonnie ship the Diamond*
>
> *Goes a-hunting for the whale*

Along the quay at Peterhead

The lasses stand around

Wi\' their shawls all pulled around them

And the salt tears runnin\' down

Don\'t you weep, my bonnie wee lass

Though you be left behind

For the rose will grow on Greenland\'s ice

Before we change our mind

Here\'s a health to the *Resolution*

Likewise the *Eliza Swan*

Three cheers for the *Battler of Montrose*

And the *Diamond*, ship of fame

We wear the trousers of the white

The jackets of the blue

When we get back to Peterhead

We\'ll have full pockets too

It will be bright both day and night

When the Greenland lads come home

Our ship full up with oil, my lads

And money to our name

We\'ll make the cradles for to rock

And the blankets for to tear

And every lass in Peterhead sing

\"Hushabye, my dear\"
