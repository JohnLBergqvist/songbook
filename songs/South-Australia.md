In South Australia I was born

_(To me) heave away, haul away_

In South Australia round Cape Horn

_We're bound for South Australia_



Haul away you rolling Kings

_(To me) heave away, haul away_

Haul away, you'll hear me sing

_We're bound for South Australia_



As I walked out one morning fair

'Twas there I met miss Nancy Blair



She shook me up and I shook her down

We shook around and round the town



We run all night and we run all day

We ran until I sailed away



There ain't but one thing grieves me mind

To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind



As we wallop 'round Cape Horn

You'll wish to god you'd never been born



In South Australia my native land

Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand



I wish I was on Australia's strand

With a bottle of whiskey in my hand
