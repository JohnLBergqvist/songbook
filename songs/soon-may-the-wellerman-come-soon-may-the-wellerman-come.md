There was a ship that put to sea, 

The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea 

The winds blew up, her bow dipped down, 

O blow, my bully boys, blow.



_Soon may the Wellerman come_ 

_And bring us sugar and tea and rum._ 

_One day, when the tonguin' is done,_ 

_We'll take our leave and go._



She had not been two weeks from shore 

When down on her a right whale bore. 

The captain called all hands and swore 

He'd take that whale in tow. 



_Soon may the Wellerman come..._

__

Before the boat had hit the water 

The whale's tail came up and caught her. 

All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her 

When she dived down below. 



_Soon may the Wellerman come..._



No line was cut, no whale was freed; 

The Captain's mind was not of greed, 

But he belonged to the whaleman's creed; 

She took the ship in tow. 



_Soon may the Wellerman come..._



For forty days, or even more, 

The line went slack, then tight once more. 

All boats were lost (there were only four) 

But still the whale did go. 



_Soon may the Wellerman come..._



As far as I've heard, the fight's still on; 

The line's not cut and the whale's not gone. 

The Wellerman makes his regular call 

To encourage the Captain, crew, and all.



_Soon may the Wellerman come..._
