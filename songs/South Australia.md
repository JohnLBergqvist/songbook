In South Australia I was born

(To me) heave away, haul away

In South Australia round Cape Horn

We\'re bound for South Australia

Haul away you rolling Kings

(To me) heave away, haul away

Haul away, you\'ll hear me sing

We\'re bound for South Australia

As I walked out one morning fair

\'Twas there I met miss Nancy Blair

I shook her up and I shook her down

I shook her round and round the town

I run her all night and I run her all day

And I run her until we sailed away

There ain\'t but one thing grieves me mind

To leave miss Nancy Blair behind

As we wallop 'round Cape Horn

You\'ll wish to god you\'d never been born

In South Australia my native land

Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand

I wish I was on Australia\'s strand

With a bottle of whiskey in my hand
