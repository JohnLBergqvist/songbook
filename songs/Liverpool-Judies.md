  This song was borderline. Although Auntie Shanty doesn't take an anti sex work
  stance, we felt that "Liverpool judies have got us in tow" has the
  connotations of male sailors being led on and disadvantaged, putting the
  female sex workers on the back foot. Liverpool as a Victorian era seaport is
  sometimes called the "Victorian England's capital of prostitution" and far
  from empowerment, many women turned to sex work through the lack of education
  and employment opportunities. They were vilified by the police and legislators
  (concerned apparently with public health). [Here is an interesting

  about some of these women!

When I was a youngster I sailed with the rest\
On a Liverpool packet bound out for the West.\
We anchored one day in the harbour of Cork,\
Then we put out for the port of New York.

_And it's row, row bullies, row,_\
_Them Liverpool Tugboats have got us in tow._

For forty two days we was hungry and sore.\
Oh, the winds was again'us, the gales, they did roar.\
But off Battery Point we did anchor at last\
With our jib'boom hove to and the canvas all fast.

The boarding house masters was off in a trice\
A'shouting and promising all that was nice,\
And one fat old crimp took a fancy to me.\
Says he, "You're a fool, lad, to follow the sea.''

Says he, "There's a job as is waiting for you,\
With lashings o'liquor and bugger'all to do.''\
Says he, "Wha'd'yer say, lad, will you jump her too?''\
Says I, "You old bastard, I'm damned if I do.''

But the best of intentions, they never goes far.\
After thirty two days at the door of a bar\
I tossed off me liquor and what do you think?\
That rotten old bastard had drugs in me drink.

The next I remember, I woke in the morn\
On a three skys'l yarder bound south round Cape Horn.\
With an old suit of oilskins and two pairs of socks\
And a bloomin' great head and a dose of the pox.

Now all you young sailors take a warnin' by me.\
Keep an eye on yer drinks when the liquor is free.\
And pay no attention to runner or whore\
When your hat's on your head and your feet's on the shore.
