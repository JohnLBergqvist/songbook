In eighteen hundred and forty-six\
And of March the eighteenth day,\
We hoisted our colours to the top of the mast\
_And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys,_\
_And for Greenland sailed away._

The lookout in the crosstrees stood\
With spyglass in his hand;\
There's a whale, there's a whale, and a whalefish he cried\
_And she blows at every span, brave boys_\
_And she blows at every span._

The captain stood on the quarter deck,\
The ice was in his eye;\
Overhaul, overhaul! let your gibsheets fall,\
_And you'll put your boats to sea, brave boys_\
_And you'll put your boats to sea._

Our harpoon struck and the line played out,\
With a single flourish of his tail,\
He capsized the boat and we lost five men,\
_And we did not catch the whale, brave boys,_\
_And we did not catch the whale._

The losing of those five jolly men,\
It grieved the captain sore,\
But the losing of that fine whalefish\
_Now it grieved him ten times more, brave boys_\
_Now it grieved him ten times more._

Oh Greenland is a barren land\
A land that bears no green\
Where there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow\
_And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys_\
_And the daylight's seldom seen._
