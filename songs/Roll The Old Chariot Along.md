Well a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn\'t do us any harm

And a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn\'t do us any harm

And a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn\'t do us any harm

And we\'ll all hang on behind

And we\'ll roll the old chariot along (x3)

We\'ll roll the old chariot along

And we\'ll roll the old chariot along

And we\'ll all hang on behind

Well a nice watch below wouldn\'t do us any harm (x3)

Well a nice glass of beer wouldn\'t do us any harm (x3)

Well a pot of Irish stew wouldn\'t do us any harm (x3)

Well some rum, beer and baccy wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Well a night on shore wouldn\'t do us any harm (x3)
