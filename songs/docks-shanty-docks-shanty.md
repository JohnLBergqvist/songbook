Oh my name is De Clisson, no sailor am I,

But away 'cross the waves I am forced now to fly,

For the king whom I faithfully once bent my knee,

Has taken my lover, away from me

__

_So I'll paint my sails red, and I'll sail out to sea,_

_And I don't care who they send to subjugate me,_

_With my axe I'll avenge on this patriarchy,_

_On those w’took my lover, away from me_



Now boys look on the ramparts,

Your father's up there,

Or his head is at least and his body's somewhere,

Though your eyes fill with pity, my own fill with rage,

We will have or vengeance, I swear it this day.



_So I'll paint my sails red, and I'll sail out to sea,_

_And I don't care who they send to subjugate me,_

_With my axe I'll avenge on this patriarchy,_

_On those w’took my lover, away from me_



So the French call me "traitor", that England is "home",

Thought I fight for myself, I am no one's to own,

'long this small stretch of coastline, shall my ship sail free,

A nightmare before whom the French will soon flee,



_So I'll paint my sails red, and I'll sail out to sea..._



Oh my name is De Clisson, a pirate am I,

And as mother and matriarch proudly I'll die,

And those men who so bravely, besmirch'd my name,

So quickly turn cowards out here on the main. 



_So I'll paint my sails red, and I'll sail out to sea..._
