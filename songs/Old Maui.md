It\'s a damn tough life full of toil and strife

We whalermen undergo

And we don\'t give a damn when the day is done

How hard the winds did blow

\'cause we\'re homeward bound from the Artic ground

With a good ship, taut and free

And we don\'t give a damn when we drink our rum

With the girls of old Maui

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys

Rolling down to old Maui

We\'re homeward bound from the Artic ground

Rolling down to old Maui

Once more we sail with a northerly gale

Towards our island home.

Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done

And we ain\'t got far to roam

Six hellish months we passed away

On the cold Kamchatka sea

But now we\'re bound from the Artic ground

Rolling down to old Maui.

Once more we sail with a northerly gale

Through the ice and wind and rain

Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands

We soon shall see again

Our stu\'n\'s\'l booms is carried away

What care we for that sound?

A living gale is after us

Thank god we\'re homeward bound

How soft the breeze through the island trees

Now the ice is far astern

Them native maids, them tropical glades

Is a-waiting our return

Even now their big brown eyes look out

Hoping some fine day to see

Our baggy sails runnin\' \'fore the gales

Rolling down to old Maui
