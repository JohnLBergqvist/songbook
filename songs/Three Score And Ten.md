Methinks I see a host of craft

Spreading their sails alee

Down the humber they do glide

All bound for the Northern sea

Methinks I see on each small craft

A crew with hearts so brave

Going out to earn their daily bread

Upon the restless wave

And it\'s three score and ten

Boys and men were lost from Grimsby town

From yarmouth down to Scarborough

Many hundreds more were drowned

Our herring craft, our Trawlers

Our fishing Smacks, as well

They long to fight the bitter night

And battle with the swell

Methinks I see them yet again

As they leave this land behind

Casting their nets into the sea

The herring shoals to find

Methinks I see them yet again

They\'re all on board all right

With their nets rolled up and their decks cleaned off

And the side lights burning bright

Methinks I\'ve heard the Captain say

\"me lads we\'ll shorten sail\"

With the sky to all appearances

Looks like an approaching gale

Methinks I see them yet again

The midnight hour is past

The little craft a battling

There against the icy blast

October\'s night brought such a sight

\'twas never seen before

There were mast and yards and broken spars

Awashed up on the shore

There were many a heart in sorrow

Many a heart so brave

There were many a fine and hearty lad

That met a watery grave
