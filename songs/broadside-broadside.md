Keep your land you gentry of England, France and Spain\
For there’s nothing like dominion of the water\
From the rocky coast of Kerry to the bloody Spanish Main\
It’s the best thing you can ever teach your daughter

_Broadside to broadside, two captains collide_\
_Queen of the spheres and queen of the tide_\
_Regalia and rebellion go sailing side by side_\
_Haul away, sister, haul away_

Plunder men for treasure, and never heed their blows\
For there’s nothing given freely to a woman\
Be generous to friendship and lavish to your foes\
Then pirate queens may share the seas in common

_Broadside to broadside, two captains collide..._

For blows will make you weary and marriage make a slave\
You’d be better on the sea like brave O’Malley\
And when that gallant vessel goes a rolling on the wave\
Be sure you’re on the deck not in the galley

_Broadside to broadside, two captains collide..._
