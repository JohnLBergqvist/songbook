The Navy would never have a lass at sea

Away Santianna

So I went in search of piracy

Along the coast of Mexico



So heave her up and away we'll go, Heave away Santianna!

To Mexico where the warm winds blow, Along the coast of Mexico



And now we sail the Southern Seas

Away Santianna

And we'll have those lady-lads on their knees

Along the coast of Mexico



In Mexico I want to be

Away Santianna

With a cask of rum on a drinkin' spree

Along the coast of Mexico



When I was a young lass singing prime

Away Santianna

I had them Irish lads two at a time

Along the coast of Mexico



But I'd never leave the sea to settle down

Away Santianna

When I can have a lad in every town

Along the coast of Mexico



Though the times is hard and the riches low

Away Santianna

Ah but we pirates must all "row and yo‚Äù

Along the coast of Mexico
