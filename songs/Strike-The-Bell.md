Aft on the Poopdeck\
Walking about\
There is the Second Mate\
So sturdy and so stout\
What he is thinking of\
He only knows himself\
Oh, we wish that he would hurry up\
And strike, strike the bell

_Strike the bell, Second Mate_\
_Let us go below_\
_Look away to windward_\
_You can see it's going to blow_\
_Look at the glass_\
_You can see that it is fell_\
_We wish the you would hurry up_\
_And strike, strike the bell_

Down on the maindeck\
Working at the pumps\
There is the larboard watch\
Ready for their bunks\
Over to windward\
They see a great swell\
They're wishing that the Second Mate\
Would strike, strike the bell

Aft at the wheel\
Poor Anderson stands\
Grasping the spokes\
In his cold, mittened hands\
Looking at the compass\
The course is clear as hell\
He's wishing that the Second Mate\
Would strike, strike the bell

For'ad in the fo'c'sle head\
Keeping sharp lookout\
There is Johnny standing\
Ready for to shout\
"lights' burning bright, Sir\
And everything is well"\
He's wishing that the Second Mate\
Would strike, strike the bell

Aft the quarterdeck\
The gallant Captain stands\
Looking to windward\
With his glasses in his hand\
What he is thinking of\
We know very well\
He's thinking more of shortening sail\
Than strike, strike the bell
