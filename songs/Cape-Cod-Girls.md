description: >-
  This was likely used as a long haul or halyard shanty. It's a variant on
  'South Australia'. The named town could be substituted for the name of another
  fishing town, should the sailors wish the song's jokes to be at someone else's
  expense.

Cape Cod girls ain't got no combs

> _Haul away, haul away_

They comb their hair with codfish bones

> _And we're bound away for Australia_
>
> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_
>
> _Haul away, haul away_
>
> _Heave away, why don't you make some noise_
>
> _And we're bound away for Australia_

Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds\
They slide down the hills on codfish heads

Cape Cod men ain't got no ale\
They fill their glasses with codfish tails

Cape Cod folk ain't got no ills\
Cape Cod doctors give 'em codfish pills\
\
Cape Cod mothers don't bake no pies\
They feed their kids on codfish eyes\
\
Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails\
They got blown off by the northeast gales
