General Taylor's dead and gone

Walk him along, John, carry him along

Oh, General Taylor's dead and gone

Carry him to his burying ground



_To me way hey, you Stormy_

_Walk him along, John, carry him along_

_To me way hey, you Stormy_

_Carry him to his burying ground_



Oh I wish that I was old Stormy's son

I'd build him a ship o' ten thousand tons



_To me way hey, you Stormy_...



I'd load her down with ale and rum

And every shellback should have some



Oh we dug his grave with a silver spade

His shroud of the softest silk were made



We lowered him down on a golden chain

At every link we shouted his name



Oh, General Taylor fought in the fray

And General Taylor gained the day
