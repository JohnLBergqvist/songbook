What shall we do with the Patriarchy?\
What shall we do with the Patriarchy?\
Let’s do away with the whole malarky\
Smash the Patriarchy!

_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Early in the morning_

A fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Hooray and up she rises_\
_Early in the morning_

Girls just wanna have fundamental human rights x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

_Hooray and up she rises..._

End circumcision and FGM x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

No human being is illegal x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

Open minds and open hearts x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

It’s my body, so it’s my choice x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

We want shared parental leave x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

Fight for change, and fight for freedom x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

Why are you so obsessed with my uterus? x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

We want bread and we want roses x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!

Love is love is love is love x3\
Smash the Patriarchy!
