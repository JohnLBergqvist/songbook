We come on the sloop John B

My Grandfather and me

Around Nassau town we did roam

Drinkin\' all night

Got into a fight

Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

> *See how the main sails set*

> *Call for the captain ashore, let me go home*

First mate, he got drunk

Broke up the people\'s trunk

Constable had to come and take him away

Sheriff John Stone

Why don\'t you leave me alone?

Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

Well, the poor cook he caught the fits

Threw away all of my grits

Then he took and he ate up all of my corn

Let me go home

I want to go home

This is the worst trip I\'ve ever been on
