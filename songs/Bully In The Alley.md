So Help Me Bob, I\'m Bully In The Alley\
Way, Hey, Bully In The Alley

So Help Me Bob, I\'m Bully In The Alley\
Bully Down In Shinbone Al

Sally Is A Girl That I Loved Dearly

Way, Hey, Bully In The Alley\
Sally Is The Gal That I Spliced Nearly

Bully Down In Shinbone Al

For Seven Long Years I Courted Little Sally,

All She Did Was Dilly And Dally,

I Left My Sal, I Went A-Sailing

Signed On A Big Ship, I Went A-Whaling

If Ever I Get Back, I\'ll Marry Little Sally,

Have Six Kids And Live In Shinbone Alley,

I Thought I Heard The Old Man Saying,

One More Pull And We\'re Belaying.
