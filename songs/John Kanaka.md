I thought I heard the old man say

*John Kanaka-naka too lie ay*

Today, today is a holiday

*John Kanaka-naka too lie ay*

*Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay (hoo)*

*John Kanaka-naka too lie ay*

We\'ll work tomorrow but no work today

We\'ll work tomorrow but no work today

We\'re bound away for \'Frisco Bay

We\'re bound away at the break of day

We\'re bound away \'round Cape Horn

We wish to Christ we\'d never been born

Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away

Oh haul away and make your pay

And we are Liverpool born and bred

We\'re strong in the arm but we\'re thick in the head
