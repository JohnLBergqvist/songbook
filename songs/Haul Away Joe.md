description: An ironic singing of verse 3 can be enhanced with another verse in dialogue. I've had a stab here where our sailor discovers that maybe he doesn't want to kiss the girls after all, which you can feel free to omit.

Louis was the king of France

Before the revolut-i-on

*Away, haul away, we\'ll haul away Joe*

But then he got his head chopped off

Which spoiled his constitut-i-on

*Away, haul away, we\'ll haul away Joe*

> *(To me) way, haul away*
>
> *We\'ll heave and hang together*

> *Away, haul away, we\'ll haul away Joe*

Once I was in Ireland

Digging turf and pratties

And now I\'m on a Yankee ship

Hauling on sheets and braces

Now when I was a little boy

And so me mother told me

That if I didn\'t kiss the girls

Me lips would all grow mouldy

\*\*\*\*Well now I only kiss the boys

It's them I like to hold me

I can't say I miss the girls

And me lips did not go mouldy\*\*\*

Way haul away

We\'ll haul away the bowline

Way, haul away

The packet is a-rollin\'
