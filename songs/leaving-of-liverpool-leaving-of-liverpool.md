Farewell to you my own true love

I'm going far away

I'm bound for California

but I know that I'll return some day



_So fare thee well, my own true love_

_When I return, united we will be_

_It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me_ 

_But my darling when I think of thee_



Farewell to Prince's Landing Stage 

River Mersey, fare thee well 

I am bound for California 

A place I know right well 



_So fare thee well, my own true love_

_When I return, united we will be_

_It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me_ 

_But my darling when I think of thee_

__

I'm bound for California 

By the way of stormy Cape Horn 

And I promise to write you a letter, love 

When I am homeward bound 



_So fare thee well..._

__

I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship 

Davy Crockett is her name 

And Burgess is the captain of her

And they say she's a floating shame



_So fare thee well..._



I have sailed with Burgess once before 

And I think I know him well 

If a man's a seaman, he can get along 

If not, then he's sure in Hell 



_So fare thee well..._

__

Farewell to lower Frederick Street 

Ensign Terrace and Park Lane 

For I think it will be a long, long time 

Before I see you again 



_So fare thee well..._

__

Oh the sun is on the harbour, love 

And I wish I could remain 

For I know it will be a long, long time 

until I see you again 



_So fare thee well..._
