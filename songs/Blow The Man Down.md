description: The Black Ball Line was the name of two fleets of transatlantic packet ships, one based in Liverpool and the other based in the US and boasting some of the finest sailing clippers in the world. The Liverpool branch of the line operated from 1852 until 1871. The 'Kicking Jack Williams' (often incorrectly named 'Jack Rogers' in other versions) was a captain on the American side of the Black Ball Line. Infamous for his tough discipline on board, he became famous for driving the 1,679 ton clipper* Andrew Jackson *on a record-breaking run from New York to San Francisco when he made the voyage in under 90 days in 1859.

Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,

*To me way, hey, blow the man down*

Now please pay attention and listen to me

*Give me some time to blow the man down*

*Blow the man down to me, blow the man down*

*To me way, hey, blow the man down*

*Blow him right back to LIverpool town,*

*Give me some time to blow the man down*

I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong,

You give me some whiskey I'll sing you a song

'Twas on a black baller I first served my time,

On a trim black ball liner I wasted me prime,

When a trim black ball liner's preparing for sea

You'll split your sides laughing, such sights you would see

There's tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all

They're all shipped for sailors aboard the black ball

When a big black ball liner's a leaving her dock,

All of the town to the pier head do flock

Now when the big liner, she's clear of the land

Our bosun he roars out the word of command

"Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop,

Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot"

Pay attention to orders now, you one and all,

For see high above, there flies the Black Ball

'Tis larboard and starboard on deck you will sprawl,

For Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball
