description: >-
  The Black Ball Line was the name of two fleets of transatlantic packet ships,
  one based in Liverpool and the other in New York. 'Kicking Jack Williams' was
  a captain on the American side. Infamous for tough discipline on board, he was
  also famed for record-breaking runs.

Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
Now please pay attention and listen to me\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
_Blow him right back to LIverpool town,_\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
You give me some whiskey I'll sing you a song\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
_Blow him right back to LIverpool town,_\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_\
\
'Twas on a black baller I first served my time,\
_To me..._\
On a trim black ball liner I wasted me prime\
_Give me..._

_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down..._

When a trim black ball liner's preparing for sea\
You'll split your sides laughing, such sights you would see\
\
There's tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all\
They're all shipped for sailors aboard the black ball

When a big black ball liner's a leaving her dock,\
All of the town to the pier head do flock\
\
Now when the big liner, she's clear of the land\
Our bosun he roars out the word of command

"Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop,\
Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot"\
\
Pay attention to orders now, you one and all,\
For see high above, there flies the Black Ball

'Tis larboard and starboard on deck you will sprawl,\
For Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball
