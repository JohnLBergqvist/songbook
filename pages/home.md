# Welcome to Auntie Shanty!

This is an open folk music session where all are welcome to sing sea songs and shanties.

It was set up in 2015 by Hannah Jakes as an intersectional, feminist session - we respect the history and tradition of shanties but also respect the diversity of people who come to sing and socialise here, so we edit and update some songs to make sure weâ€™re not perpetuating outdated views.

There's a lot more information over at the [FAQ](about)

For any of the technical info about what's going on see the [project repo]({{ pkg.repository.url }}) on Github.
