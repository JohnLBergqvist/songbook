If you'd like to add songs, improve the site (please help, especially Front End developers), or generally help out in some way, we'd really appreciate it.

In preparation for the first session with a songbook, we've written a long FAQ over at the [about](about) page. Feedback on this is welcome, perhaps via the [contact](contact) page, or in person at a session if you like.

Hurrah, M'hearties, let's sing!
