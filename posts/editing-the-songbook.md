This website is built so that it's easy for other people to contribute to it and edit it. _If you're familiar with GitHub and 'git' in general then you can head over to the_ [_songbook repository_](https://github.com/singaround/songbook) _and edit there/make pull requests._ 

If you'd like to help (thanks!) there are a few steps you need to take to get access to edit the songs without needing to use techy tools

1. Come to a session and say 'hi' to the organisers.
2. Create a [GitHub Account ](https://github.com) (in order to avoid building lots of stuff for user management, we're using GitHub as our tool for this, which ties into the way we publish the site)
3. Using the [contact form](/contact) on the site, tell us what your GitHub username is, and remind us who you are so we know we're not handing over the keys to a random stranger from the internet!

Once you've done this, we'll give you access to the site on GitHub and this will allow you to log into https://www.auntieshanty.org/admin/

From here, you can see all the songs and add new ones. Please feel free to make obvious fixes to existing published songs (fix a broken chorus, typo, etc), but as many of the words that are here took some debate to arrive at, please don't make substantial changes to existing songs unless you've already discussed them with the other songbook editors (more below).

To add a song, first choose the 'song' collection, and then click 'new song' (you can also use the 'quick add' in the top right hand corner).

![How to add a song](/static/img/edit-new-song.png "Adding a song")

This will take you to the song edit screen. 

![Overview of adding songs](/static/img/edit-song-interface.png "Entering the details of a song")

The 'visible' toggle is what determines whether a song is officially 'in the songbook'. **Please don't toggle this to 'on' yet.**

On this screen you should enter all the details of your song, including a short description if you like. The actual song words are at the bottom of the page. It goes without saying, but please only add original songs (credit yourself or choose 'anon' if you like), traditional songs, or songs you have express permission to reproduce if they are in copyright 

You can add tags if you want, but all songs need the 'song' tag to be correctly shown in the right places on the site.

![Use italic and block quote for choruses](/static/img/edit-song-words.png "Editing the song words")

Our convention is to use 'quotes' and italics for the chorus (there are plenty of songs that need to be brought in line with this yet, you're welcome to help!), so that it looks like this:

> This is a line from a chorus

You can get these on the toolbar when using the 'rich text' editor, or if you want to use [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) instead then use the following

```
> _This is a line from a chorus_
```

...where songs have 'everyone sing' lines in the verses, you can just italicise them, as the 'quotes' thing breaks up the flow for the lead singer.

Once you're done with editing, you should click 'publish' (in the top right). If the song is not listed as 'visible' (which we'd prefer it isn't right away) then it won't show up in the songbook, but it will be listed on the '[unfiltered songs](/unfiltered-songs)' page. Songs will take a few minutes to show up, as the site gets rebuilt and redeployed for each change. 

Once you've added a song, or many songs, please [raise an issue here](https://github.com/singaround/songbook/issues) that lists the songs you've added and asks someone to look over them and make them visible. You can '@mention' _@CaptainSharks_ or _@RogerioY_ for song-related things, or @singaround for things that are broken.

...or you can click this: [I have finished a song](https://github.com/singaround/songbook/issues/new) ... that'll open an issue for you.

 When editing, please be aware that everyone has full control, so please don't edit songs you didn't create, or if you can't remember, you can [file and 'issue'](https://github.com/singaround/songbook/issues/new) requesting a change or suggesting it.
